% move according to the pattern 

% encoding of the pattern for Simulink in an m by 2 matix where m is the
% numer of move commands. The first row stands for the number of rows to be
% skipped and the second for the direction.
% left = 1
% right = -1

% example pattern: S-2R-4L-2L-5R-F

p = [2, -1;... % 2R
     4,  1;... % 4L
     2,  1;... % 2L
     5, -1];   % 5R
