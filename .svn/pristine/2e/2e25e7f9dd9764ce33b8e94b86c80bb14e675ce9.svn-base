For publishing a stream of a webcam you have to execute the my_camera_publisher Node with the specific camera id as an argument. You can get the id with the command "$ls /dev/video*".

For example:
$rosrun camera_package my_camera_publisher 0 

If you want to check if the published video stream is working, you can execute the my_subscriber node which should show the video stream in a window.
